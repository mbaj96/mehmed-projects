data analyst/data science personal projects

This repository contains a number of projects which I have worked on - generally analysing datasets to answer potential business questions the datasets pose. Analysis mostly performed using Python and libraries such as Scikitlearn, Matplotlib, Pandas and numpy - however there are also notebooks which use SQL entirely.
